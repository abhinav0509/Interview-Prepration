 Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k

 Given an integer array and a positive integer k, count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k.

 Question source: hackerank pairs problem

 Examples:

 Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 2}, k = 3
 Output: 2
 There are 2 pairs with difference 3, the pairs are {1, 4} and {5, 2}

 Input: arr[] = {8, 12, 16, 4, 0, 20}, k = 4
 Output: 5
 There are 5 pairs with difference 4, the pairs are {0, 4}, {4, 8},
 {8, 12}, {12, 16} and {16, 20}




 Algorithm

     1)Sort the array arr
     2)Take two pointers, l and r, both pointing to 1st element
     3)Take the difference arr[r] â€“ arr[l]
     4)If value diff is K, increment count and move both pointers to next element
     5)if value diff > k, move l to next element
     6)if value diff < k, move r to next element
     7)return count

       int k=2; //difference to observe
       int result=countPairs(arr,k);
        System.out.println("The number of pairs with required diff are "+ result);
